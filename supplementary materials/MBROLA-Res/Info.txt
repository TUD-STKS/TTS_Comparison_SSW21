The "MBROLA-Resynthesis" samples were created using the open source software MBROLA:

https://github.com/numediart/MBROLA

The samples were synthesized in order to match the phone durations and the pitch of natural speech recordings.
The ".pho" data files (in the subfolder "./MBROLA-Resynthesis/data/") contain the information neccessary to reproduce the audio samples.

Important information regarding the resynthesis with MBROLA:
•	For the MBROLA resynthesis, exactly the same phone durations were used as in the VocalTractLab resynthesis (which was done first). 
	The VTL phone durations can be found in the ".seg" files (see subfolder "./VTL-Resynthesis/data/").
•	The database on the male German speaker "de2" does not contain a glottal stop. Existing glottal stops in the ".seg" files used in the 
	VTL resynthesis were split half and half between the left and right neighbouring sounds.
•	Secondary diphthongs such as "o:6" were broken down into the two individual vowels, each with half the total duration.
•	For the f0 contour, on average as many f0 support points were used as there are phones in the utterance.
