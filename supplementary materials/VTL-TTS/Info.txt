The "VTL-TTS" samples were created using the open source software VocalTractLab (VTL):

https://vocaltractlab.de/

In order to create the segment sequences (".seg" files) and gestural scores (".ges" files) that are needed for the articulatory synthesis with VTL,
a VTL-TTS pipeline as described in 
"S. Stone et al., “Prospects of articulatory text-to-speech synthesis,” in Proc. ISSP, 2020 (Accepted)" was used.




The ".seg" and ".ges" data files (in the subfolder "./VTL-Resynthesis/data/") contain the information neccessary to reproduce the audio samples.

To synthesize a sample, open the VTL GUI and click "File"->"Load Gestural Score"->"Synthesize".
For more detailed instructions how to use VTL, see the VTL manual.
