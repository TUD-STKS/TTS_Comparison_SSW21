The "VTL-Resynthesis" samples were created using the open source software VocalTractLab (VTL):

https://vocaltractlab.de/

The samples were synthesized in order to match the phone durations and the pitch of natural speech recordings.
The ".seg" and ".ges" data files (in the subfolder "./VTL-Resynthesis/data/") contain the information neccessary to reproduce the audio samples.

To synthesize a sample, open the VTL GUI and click "File"->"Load Gestural Score"->"Synthesize".
For more detailed instructions how to use VTL, see the VTL manual.
